1. install renv
    R
    install.packages('renv')
2. create a new project environment, similar to a Python virtual environment
    renv::init
3. install and remove R packages as necessary
4. Save the dependencies/packages used in the project to renv.lock (the lockfile)
    renv::snapshot
5. install and remove R packages as necessary
6. save the project state by calling renv::snapshot again, or go back to the previous state as recorded
   by the lockfile with renv::restore

When committing files to git, make sure to commit the .Rprofile, renv.lock and renv/activate.R file.
Also, it might be helpful to commit the renv/.gitignore file.
the renv/library folder is usually ignored. renv::init will write the required ignore statements to .gitignore.
